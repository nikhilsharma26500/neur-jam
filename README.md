# NeurJAM Project

Welcome to the NeurJAM Project! My mission is to create a versatile playground for Large Language Models (LLMs), where users can experiment with various LLMs in real-time. This project aims to support a wide range of functionalities, including text-to-text generation, vision capabilities, web scraping and more.

## Supported Large Language Models (LLMs)

We are excited to offer support for a variety of leading LLMs, enabling users to explore and utilize these models in their projects:

- **GPT Models**: Experience the power of OpenAI's Generative Pre-trained Transformer models for a variety of tasks.
- **Gemini Models**: Dive into the capabilities of Gemini Models, designed for specific and nuanced applications.
- **Claude Models**: Explore Claude Models, known for their efficiency and adaptability across different tasks.
- **Llama Models (through Fireworks AI)**: Leverage Llama Models via Fireworks AI for cutting-edge performance and innovation.
